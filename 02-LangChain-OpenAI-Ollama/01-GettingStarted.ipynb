       "AIMessage(content='Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that is designed to create new content, data, or information by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily focuses on analyzing or interpreting data, generative AI can produce novel outputs such as text, images, music, and more.\\n\\nKey features of generative AI include:\\n\\n1. **Learning from Data**: Generative AI models are trained on large datasets, allowing them to understand the underlying patterns and structures within the data.\\n\\n2. **Content Creation**: These models can generate new examples that resemble the training data. For instance, they can write stories, compose music, create realistic images, or produce any type of content that is similar to what they have been trained on.\\n\\n3. **Techniques Used**: Common techniques in generative AI include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).\\n\\n4. **Applications**: Generative AI has numerous applications, including art and design, gaming, virtual reality, drug discovery, natural language processing, and more.\\n\\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The rise of generative AI also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for misuse in creating deepfakes, misinformation, and the implications of copyright and ownership regarding generated content.\\n\\nOverall, generative AI represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to create and innovate in ways that were previously thought to be exclusive to human creativity.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 310, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 323, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f85bea6784', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d9fa21cb-e7d8-43ec-b5d4-d817661373b3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 310, 'total_tokens': 323})"
